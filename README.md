# Flight_Log_Analyser

Python based Flight Log Analyser on sensor data with FFT plot to set filter cutoff frequencies correctly on Flight Firmware.

Logging is part of my CKFlight flight controller firmware. I added format in "log_format.c" file to show which format is parsed and ploted by Python file.
